# Google-Interest-Over-Time-To-File

Google Trends (trends.google.com) is a reference in many different domains to analyze if a topic is trending or not, especially compared to other topics
Without a subscription you normally look at the Explore screen, add topics, and get a visual impression of what is trending and what is not.

But it is not easy to do this regularly on a large number of topics or keywords

So this tool gets you more workable data in seconds

To test or use the tool, you can:
- Go to thomasmoor dot org
- Click on Google Trends
- Select up to 5 keywords
  For exmple I choose to compare USA Germany Russia China Argentina
- Press Search

The data is collected from Google Trends and will appear below.
It displays:
- The topics or keywords you selected together with
- the last value of the trending
- The maximum value on the last 5 years
- The minimum value on the last 5 years
- The average value on the last 5 years
- The average value on the last year
- The average value on the last 6 weeks

Comparing the different averages can give you an idea of the trend

You can also save the data into a csv file, for better analysis
